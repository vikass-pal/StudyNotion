# Comprehensive Plan to Address Instructor Route Issue


## Plan:

1. **Verify Token Handling**:
   - Ensure that the token is being sent correctly from the client-side when accessing the `/instructorDashboard` route.
   - Check if the token is valid and properly decoded in the `auth.js` middleware.

2. **Check User Role**:
   - Confirm that the `accountType` is correctly set to "Instructor" in the token payload when the user logs in.
   - If the instructor is logged in but still receiving an error, investigate how the `accountType` is being assigned during the login process in the `Auth.js` controller.

3. **Review Instructor Dashboard Logic**:
   - In the `instructorDashboard` function in `Profile.js`, ensure that the courses are being correctly associated with the instructor's ID.
   - If no courses are linked to the instructor's ID, investigate the database entries for the instructor to ensure they have courses assigned.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement additional logging in the `auth.js` middleware and the `instructorDashboard` function to capture more detailed error messages.
   - This will help identify where the failure occurs in the authentication or course retrieval process.

5. **Testing**:
   - After making the necessary changes, test the `/instructorDashboard` route to ensure that instructors can access their dashboard without encountering errors.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
